    <h2> MapManJS </h2>
    A pure web implementations of MapMan over represention analysis and MapMan visualization
    
    <h3> MapMan JS </h3>

    This is a new implementation of MapMan partially translating the original Java sources
xml parsing is rudimentary at the moment and might be in the future become obsolete
    a portable rewrite of MapMan in Javascript <a href="https://usadellab.github.io/MapManJS/ultramicro.html"> micromapman</a>
    
    <h3> Over Representation Analysis </h3>
    <a href="https://usadellab.github.io/MapManJS/test_oo11.html"> ORA </a> <br/> 

Starting with enrichment analysis for categories. This relies on a D3 v3 at the moment. Genes are counted in both your selection as well as in the reference and then for each Bin a Fisher's exact test for an over(under)representation is run. All p-values are globally corrected using a Benjamini Hochberg type procedure.

Statistics is a partial backport of a Java port from the GSL.
<h3> ToDo <h3>

add other charting capabilities make table more flexible port to D3 v5 add hierarchical p-value
  <h3> ChangeLog </h3>

v 0.11 first public version
v 0.12 June 2018 added first public MapMan web version
v 0.13 March 2019 ORA behaviour improved for autogenerated files
